# tradeshift-app-samples

This repository contains sample projects and starter templates for building Apps for the Tradeshift Platform.  

Additional documentation about how to build these apps is available at our [Apps site](http://apps.tradeshift.com). 

Currently, there are two sample apps available: 
* [JavaScript - Node.JS](javascript/nodejs)
* [Java - Spring.Boot and Spring Security](java-springboot) 

The apps show how to authenticate with Tradeshift using OAUTH2 framework, using three-legged authentication. They call Tradeshift APIs and display data using [Tradeshift's UI Components](http://ui.tradeshift.com). 

The apps are designed to be hosted on any service.  For simplicity, we deployed and tested these Apps on Heroku. 

More information about creating Apps on Tradeshift is available in our [developer documentation] (http://apps.tradeshift.com/documentation).  

Any feedback is welcome - please let us know at email apps at tradeshift dot com.
