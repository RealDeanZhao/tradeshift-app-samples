# tradeshift-app-samples

This repository contains sample projects and starter templates for building Apps for the Tradeshift Platform.  Additional documentation about how to build these apps is available at our [Apps site](http://apps.tradeshift.com). 

Currently, there are three sample apps available: 
* [Java - Spring.Boot and Spring Security](java-springboot) 
* [JavaScript - Node.JS](javascript/nodejs)
* [PHP - Symphony Apps](php-symfony)

The sample apps all aim to show same things, and the front end code talking to different front ends is almost identical: 
* App Authorization against Tradeshift servers using OAUTH2 three-legged approach. 
* Calling Tradeshift APIs, such as getting documents and user information. 
* Displaying CompanyCard and Locale
* REST server and Angular js frontend
* [Tradeshift's UI Components](http://ui.tradeshift.com), including table and tabs
* i18n support on the client side (and 
* Check health function for monitoring
* Unit test framework integration to get you started (some projects)

The apps are designed to be hosted on any service.  We tested these Apps on Heroku. 

More information about creating Apps on Tradeshift is available in our [developer documentation] (http://apps.tradeshift.com/documentation).
