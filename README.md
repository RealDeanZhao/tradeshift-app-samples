# tradeshift-app-samples

This repository contains sample projects and starter templates for building Apps for the Tradeshift Platform.  Additional documentation about how to build these apps is available at our [Apps site](http://apps.tradeshift.com). 

Currently, there are three sample apps available: 
* [Java - Spring.Boot and Spring Security](java-springboot) 
* [JavaScript - Node.JS](javascript/nodejs)
* [PHP - Symphony Apps](php-symfony)

The sample apps all aim to show same things, and the front end code talking to different front ends is almost identical:

The apps are designed to be hosted on any service.  We tested these Apps on Heroku. 

More information about creating Apps on Tradeshift is available in our [developer documentation] (http://apps.tradeshift.com/documentation).
